# Position storage, lifecycle, and Maturity disposition

The four position groups (Asset, Liability, Receivable, Investment) are each modelled as a separate
core table with subtype-specific extension tables where metadata is rich, and inline fields where it
is not. Every Position carries a lifecycle status independent of soft-delete. The Maturity
transaction is extended with disposition fields so it can express the real-world variants of bond
redemption and TimeDeposit rollover.

## Storage layout

Four core tables — `assets`, `liabilities`, `receivables`, `investments`. Each carries:

- `id`, `household_id`, `display_name` (required), `description`
- `ownership_type` (`'sole' | 'joint'`), `sole_owner_user_id` (FK to users, non-null when `sole`)
- `native_currency` (ISO code)
- `subtype` — a group-specific enum (omitted for `receivables`)
- `status` — a group-specific enum (default `'active'`), `terminated_at` (date, nullable),
  `termination_note` (text, nullable)
- audit fields (`created_by/at`, `updated_by/at`) and `deleted_at` (ADR-0007)

Subtype-specific metadata lives in 1:1 extension tables (`position_id` as shared PK/FK) where the
metadata set is rich. Where it fits cleanly inline (Liability, Receivable), no extension table is
used.

### Asset extensions

| Table | Fields |
|---|---|
| `bank_account_details` | `bank_name` (req), `account_number` (req), `account_type` (`'savings' \| 'current' \| 'other'`) |
| `property_details` | `property_type` (`'house' \| 'apartment' \| 'land' \| 'commercial'`), `address` (opt), `acquisition_date` (opt), `acquisition_cost` (opt), `annual_appreciation_rate` (opt, signed % /yr — positive grows, negative declines; powers the frontend revaluation helper, M6 / Q8a — renamed from `annual_amortization_rate` in migration 00019) |
| `vehicle_details` | `vehicle_type` (`'car' \| 'motorcycle' \| 'other'`), `make` (opt), `model` (opt), `year` (opt), `plate_number` (opt), `annual_depreciation_rate` (opt) |

### Investment extensions

| Table | Fields |
|---|---|
| `stock_details` | `ticker` (req), `exchange` (req) |
| `mutual_fund_details` | `fund_code` (req), `fund_manager` (opt) |
| `bond_details` | `bond_type` (`'govt_primary' \| 'secondary_market'`), `issuer` (req), `coupon_rate` (req, annual %), `coupon_frequency` (default `'monthly'`), `maturity_date` (req). **No stored `face_value`** — outstanding nominal is derived from the ledger, `(Σ buy_qty − Σ sell_qty) × 1,000,000` (issue #27, see "Placement" below; `face_value` column dropped in migration 00021). |
| `gold_details` | `form` (`'bar' \| 'coin' \| 'digital' \| 'jewelry'`), `purity` (decimal) |
| `time_deposit_details` | `bank_name` (req), `principal` (req), `interest_rate` (req, annual %), `term_months` (req), `placement_date` (req), `maturity_date` (req), `rollover_policy` (`'auto_renew_principal' \| 'auto_renew_with_interest' \| 'no_rollover'`) |

### Liability and Receivable (inline)

`liabilities` adds: `subtype` (`'personal' | 'institutional'`), `counterparty_name` (req),
`principal` (opt), `interest_rate` (opt), `term_months` (opt), `start_date` (opt), `maturity_date`
(opt).

`receivables` adds: `counterparty_name` (req), `due_date` (opt). No subtype.

## Placement — capital at entry is a transaction (issue #27)

Symmetric with the maturity rule below and with #25's exit-side fix: **capital deployed into a
position at entry is a `cash_in`, never investment return.** Without it, the placement-month snapshot
`0 → principal` reads as pure return under ADR-0008's `Δvalue + cash_out − cash_in` formula — the
entry-side twin of the #25 double-count.

- **Bonds (`govt_primary`):** placement is recorded as a **Buy** (`cash_in`), the same shape
  secondary-market bonds always carried. The create-bond flow seeds the first Buy from its
  `face_value` + `placement_date` inputs; Indonesian primary retail bonds (SBR/ST/ORI/SR) trade in
  **IDR 1,000,000 units**, so `quantity = face / 1,000,000`, `price_per_unit = 1,000,000` at par
  (`amount = quantity × price_per_unit`). Discount/premium rides on `price_per_unit ≠ 1,000,000`.
  Secondary-market bonds are **not** seeded — the user records the actual Buy with the real price.

  **Face value is ledger-derived, not stored.** Once placement is a Buy, both the held nominal and
  the cost fall out of the ledger, so the hand-maintained `bond_details.face_value` scalar was dropped
  (migration 00021) — keeping it would be a duplicated source of truth that drifts on every buy/sell
  edit (the derive-don't-duplicate principle behind ADR-0003). Outstanding face =
  `(Σ buy_qty − Σ sell_qty) × 1,000,000`; cost basis = `Σ amount` (handles premium/discount where
  cash ≠ nominal). Multi-tranche just adds Buys; the coupon helper reads the derived outstanding face
  so coupons scale across top-ups. The detail-screen Edit dialog no longer carries a `face_value`
  input — nominal is changed by adding/editing transactions.

- **Time deposits:** a TD records **no** Buy (placement lives in the Create dialog —
  `principal` + `placement_date` are already stored, and rollovers create new rows). Rather than add a
  placement transaction type, the **engine synthesizes** the placement `cash_in` from those two fields
  in the placement month (option (a) — no new txn type, no data-entry burden, no backfill: it applies
  uniformly to every existing TD). The synthetic flow is booked exactly like a Buy `cash_in`.

This is the entry half of the rule whose exit half is #25's 0-value close snapshot: combined, capital
is excluded from investment return at **both** entry and exit, leaving only yield (coupons /
interest / realized + unrealized gain).

## Gold marks at the buyback price (issue #19)

Physical/digital gold trades on a **bid/ask spread**: a dealer sells to you at the higher *selling
price* ("harga jual") and buys back from you at the lower *buyback price* ("harga beli / buyback").
The spread (Antam: ~Rp 50–100k/gram) is the cost of round-tripping the metal, not a separately
itemised fee.

The two prices already live in the ledger without any schema change: a **Buy** records
`price_per_unit` = the selling price you paid, a **Sell** records `price_per_unit` = the buyback price
you received. So realised P/L on a sale is already spread-correct via the existing
`Δvalue + cash_out − cash_in` engine (ADR-0008).

The only open decision was which price the periodic **valuation snapshot** carries between buy and
sell. **Decision: gold snapshots mark at the buyback price** — what the holding could be cashed out
for *today*, not what it would cost to re-acquire. This keeps net worth at realisable value and never
overstates it. The consequence is honest and intentional: a gold position shows an immediate
unrealised loss equal to the spread right after purchase, which closes only as the gold price rises
past the spread. We chose this over the two alternatives considered:

- **Track both prices on the snapshot** (a second price column) — rejected: it forks gold off the
  shared quantity+price snapshot shape (ADR-0022) and adds monthly data-entry burden for a number
  (the current selling price) the user doesn't need for valuation.
- **Snapshot at the selling price, book the spread as a Fee on sale** — rejected: net worth would
  read optimistically high for the entire hold, then correct in one lump at exit. Marking at buyback
  is truthful continuously.

No schema change: this is a **valuation convention** enforced by UI guidance — a "use the buyback
price" hint under the snapshot price field, distinct buy/sell hints on the trade dialogs, and a line
in the gold help tour (issue #23). Cost basis is unaffected (it replays the Buy prices actually
paid), so the spread surfaces as unrealised P/L, exactly where it economically belongs.

## Lifecycle and status

Status enums vary per group to keep values meaningful:

- **Asset**: `'active' | 'closed' | 'sold' | 'disposed'`
- **Liability**: `'active' | 'paid_off' | 'forgiven' | 'written_off'`
- **Receivable**: `'active' | 'collected' | 'written_off'`
- **Investment**: `'active' | 'sold' | 'matured'`

A Position contributes to month M's net worth only if `terminated_at IS NULL OR terminated_at >=
end_of_month(M)`. Carry-forward (ADR-0006 / Q12b) does not extend a Position past its
`terminated_at`. Historical Snapshots and Transactions remain intact; the lifecycle only governs
forward inclusion.

**Reactivation creates a new Position row** rather than flipping `terminated_at` back to NULL. This
keeps periods of non-ownership unambiguous in the audit history. Applies uniformly, including to
TimeDeposit auto-rollovers: each rollover creates a fresh TimeDeposit row with a new
`placement_date`. The chain is implicit, not modelled as a parent-child link (consistent with
CONTEXT.md).

### M4.6 implementation notes (lifecycle UI)

- **Status and `terminated_at` are kept in lockstep by a DB biconditional CHECK** (`(status =
  'active') = (terminated_at IS NULL)`, migration 00012, on all four core tables). A non-active
  status *must* carry a termination date; an active status *must not*. The repo's
  `validatePositionLifecycle` mirrors this for friendlier 400s, and the API requires `terminated_at`
  whenever the status is non-active (the UI defaults it to today).
- **Lifecycle is a dedicated action, not part of Edit.** It operates on the *parent* table, so there
  are 4 endpoints (`PATCH /api/{assets,liabilities,receivables,investments}/{id}/lifecycle`), 4 repo
  methods, and 4 SQL queries — not one per subtype. The 10 subtype Edit dialogs/Update paths are
  untouched.
- **Maturity is enforced as terminal by a hard guard, not just UI.** A Maturity transaction flips
  the investment to `matured` + sets `terminated_at` atomically (one pgx tx), and any subsequent
  transaction on a non-active investment is rejected with `ErrPositionNotActive` → 409. This
  replaces the earlier frontend-only "hide the Maturity button once one exists" band-aid.
- **Terminating an investment writes a truthful 0-value close snapshot (issue #25).** One coherent
  rule across both terminal paths — Maturity transaction *and* manual terminate (sold) — in the
  termination month: **terminate ⇒ 0-value close snapshot; proceeds are transactions.** A terminated
  position holds nothing at month-end; the cash lives in the bank (ADR-0003 decoupling). This is what
  keeps the derived investment-return correct — it is the liquidation-to-0 assumption ADR-0008's
  return formula depends on. The close snapshot is written in the subtype's shape (quantity/price `0`
  for stock/mutual_fund/gold; accrued_interest `0` for bond/time_deposit) and upserts to win over any
  value the user recorded that month. The inverse — un-terminate (the *correction* affordance below)
  — soft-deletes that close snapshot so a reactivated position carries forward its last real value
  instead of `0`. *(Investments only: they are the one group whose derived line reads cash-flow
  transactions; Asset/Liability/Receivable termination relies on `terminated_at` carry-forward
  suppression alone.)*
- **Same-row un-terminate is a *correction* affordance, not reactivation.** The terminate dialog
  lets a user switch a mis-set status back to Active (clearing `terminated_at` on the same row) to
  undo a mistake. This does **not** contradict the "reactivation creates a new row" rule above:
  genuine re-acquisition of a sold/closed position is still modelled as a fresh Create. The DB does
  not distinguish the two; the distinction is procedural. *(Flagged for revisit if audit-gap
  ambiguity ever bites — pre-alpha, accepted.)*

## Maturity transaction extension

The Maturity transaction carries explicit disposition fields so it can express all real-world
maturity events:

```
Maturity transaction:
  position_id, date
  principal_amount         (the principal at maturity)
  interest_amount          (interest accrued)
  principal_disposition    enum 'rolled_to_new' | 'cash_out'
  interest_disposition     enum 'rolled_to_new' | 'cash_out'
```

The three TimeDeposit bank policies, plus Bond redemption, map cleanly:

| Event | `principal_disposition` | `interest_disposition` | New row? | Cash to bank? |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| TD ARO with interest | `rolled_to_new` | `rolled_to_new` | yes (principal = old + interest) | nothing |
| TD ARO principal only | `rolled_to_new` | `cash_out` | yes (principal = old) | interest only |
| TD no rollover | `cash_out` | `cash_out` | no | principal + interest |
| Bond redemption | `cash_out` | `cash_out` | no | principal + final coupon |

The `time_deposit_details.rollover_policy` field is the *configured* policy and serves as a default
for the frontend Maturity-entry helper; the transaction records what actually happened (banks can
deviate; users can switch policies). Per ADR-0003, `cash_out` portions do not auto-update bank
balances.

## Considered alternatives

- **Single polymorphic `positions` table** with `group` + `subtype` enums. Rejected — the four
  groups have substantively different lifecycles (Investment has Transactions, others don't;
  Liabilities subtract from NW), and one table forces NULL handling for group-specific concerns in
  every row.
- **JSON `subtype_details` column** on each group table. Rejected — loses DB-level validation,
  blocks subtype-specific indexes (`bonds.maturity_date` for "maturing soon" views), and pushes
  schema into application code.
- **One table per subtype** (~11 tables, no group split). Rejected — cross-group queries within a
  group ("all assets") need UNIONs, and the group/subtype discriminator becomes harder to discover
  in DDL.
- **Status via final `$0` snapshot.** Rejected as the *lifecycle mechanism* — a `$0` snapshot alone
  conflates "balance = 0" with "no longer held" and, with nothing to suppress carry-forward, pollutes
  every future month's report with a stale zero. `status` / `terminated_at` remains the mechanism.
  This does **not** conflict with issue #25's 0-value *close snapshot*: there the `0` is truthful
  data for the termination month only (the position really is worth 0 at month-end), and
  `terminated_at` carry-forward suppression drops the position from the *following* month on — so the
  "stale zero" pollution this alternative warned about never occurs. The two coexist: lifecycle says
  *whether* the position counts; the close snapshot says it's worth `0` in its final month.
- **Status via soft-delete (ADR-0007).** Rejected — soft-delete is for entries that should disappear
  from history entirely; sold/closed Positions are real financial history that must remain in past
  months' reports.
- **Reactivation by clearing `terminated_at`.** Rejected — creates ambiguity about whether the
  Position was continuously held or had a gap. New row is more honest, and a frontend helper can
  copy details from the terminated row.
- **Maturity as a simple terminal event without disposition fields.** Rejected — couldn't
  distinguish ARO principal-only from ARO with-interest, both of which exist in real Indonesian
  banking.

## Consequences

- Position-related tables: 4 core + 8 extension = 12 tables. Each is small and stable once defined.
- Net worth computation must check `status` / `terminated_at` per Position when including in month
  M's aggregate.
- Carry-forward suppression on termination is a first-class concern in report generation.
- The frontend Maturity-entry form defaults dispositions from `rollover_policy` but allows override
  per event.
- Position metadata extension tables introduce 1:1 joins for drill-down views; the dashboard query
  (core columns only) doesn't pay this cost.
- `bank_account_details.account_number` and `time_deposit_details.bank_name` reference identifying
  numbers — plaintext storage is acceptable for single-Household v1; revisit with encryption-at-rest
  if real multi-Household ever launches.
